## Fifa

The data here are countries that play soccer and their attributes. The countries that play soccer, in which confederation they play for example Europe plays in Uefa. Population_share, tv_audience_share and gdp_weighted share.The data measures TV audience share for marketing purposes. The data is opensource data and can be collected from public source. The data can be used to allocate money for advertisement. The country with bigger tv audience share greater the cost of advertising in that country. The data is stored in csv (comma separated values) format. The data frame is delimited, comma is the delimiter. If it was a binary file, binary editor could be used to open it or powershell could be used as well. Since, this is a csv file Excel will most commonly be used to open the file.


```{r loading_data, echo = TRUE}

#Reading the data into R.


#echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who donâ€™t want to see the underlying R code. But echo is set to true.
